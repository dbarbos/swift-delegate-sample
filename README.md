# swift-delegate-sample
This is a basic implementation of the delegation pattern in a swift 4.0 project.

In this example I use the delegation pattern to show how can you "delegate" a method call to a different class or object from the object that implements it.

# When do I need that?
everytime you build an object that depends on the action of another object but one does not inherit the other.
